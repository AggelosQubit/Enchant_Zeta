Enchant-Zeta
Will be the external foundry for the project game of the same name.
It will allow each player to mint new ERC721 Spells NFTs that will be "useable" In game.

It will also allow players to create an account link to their Metamask public Adress using the ERC1155 Smart-Contract.
They will be able to see their "Grimoire" and the ones of other enchanters depending if they have their address.

Some system of Ladder will come up At some point depending on in game mechanics.


The architecture is complete for the first most important feature so I can now upload to git and begin the real
versionning of the webSite!

-I use Ganache from the Truffle Suite to create my SideChain

-I use pinata for the IPFS NFT Storage
